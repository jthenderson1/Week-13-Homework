## Week 4 Homework Submission File: Linux Systems Administration

### Step 1: Ensure/Double Check Permissions on Sensitive Files

1. Permissions on `/etc/shadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:ls -l /etc/shadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/shadow

2. Permissions on `/etc/gshadow` should allow only `root` read and write access.

    - Command to inspect permissions:ls -l /etc/gshadow

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/gshadow

3. Permissions on `/etc/group` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:ls -l /etc/group

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 644 /etc/group

4. Permissions on `/etc/passwd` should allow `root` read and write access, and allow everyone else read access only.

    - Command to inspect permissions:ls -l /etc/passwd

    - Command to set permissions (if needed):sudo chmod 600 /etc/passwd

### Step 2: Create User Accounts

1. Add user accounts for `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, `sara`, and `admin`.

    - Command to add each user account (include all five users): 
	sudo adduser sam   
	sudo adduser joe  
	sudo adduser amy   
	sudo adduser sara   
	sudo adduser admin

2. Ensure that only the `admin` has general sudo access.

    - Command to add `admin` to the `sudo` group: sudo usermod -aG sudo admin

### Step 3: Create User Group and Collaborative Folder

1. Add an `engineers` group to the system.

    - Command to add group:sudo addgroup engineers

2. Add users `sam`, `joe`, `amy`, and `sara` to the managed group.

    - Command to add users to `engineers` group (include all four users):
	sudo usermod -aG engineers joe
	sudo usermod -aG engineers sam
	sudo usermod -aG engineers amy
	sudo usermod -aG engineers sara

3. Create a shared folder for this group at `/home/engineers`.

    - Command to create the shared folder: sudo mkdir engineers

4. Change ownership on the new engineers' shared folder to the `engineers` group.

    - Command to change ownership of engineer's shared folder to engineer group:
	sudo chgrp engineers engineers

### Step 4: Lynis Auditing

1. Command to install Lynis:
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y lynis

2. Command to see documentation and instructions:
man lynis
lynis show commands
3. Command to run an audit:
lynis audit system
4. Provide a report from the Lynis output on what can be done to harden the system.
